# Hashmap in Javascript

This repo serve as Hashmap Project in vanilla JS for The Odin Project.
For this project, I mainly use Linked List in each bucket to prevent collisions.
When load-factor is reached, hashmap in increased by 2 \* his length.

I'm not sure if I've done the expected work on this project mainly because I've worked with Linked List, all of my functions in HashMap Class
are related to Linked List functions and seems to differ to a lot of community members project.
